# COVID-19-Global-Case-Trend-Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends between January and July 2020 using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard visualizes confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, deaths, case fatality rate (CFR), and recovery rate across regions and countries.

## Objective 
The objective of the project is to understand the spread, severity, and recovery patterns of COVID-19 across different geographic regions and to provide data-driven insights into global pandemic trends.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, stakeholders needed to understand:
- How COVID-19 cases evolved over time
- Which regions and countries recorded the highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries
- The relationship between recovery rates and fatality rates
- Regional differences in pandemic impact.
This project aims to transform raw COVID-19 data into actionable insights through visual analytics.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains global COVID-19 records from January to July 2020, including:
- Date
- Country/Region
- WHO Region
- Confirmed Cases
- Active Cases
- Recovered Cases
- Deaths

Derived metrics:
- Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
- Recovery Rate
- Growth Rate

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, dashboard design
- Excel / CSV – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- DAX – KPI calculations and time-based metrics

## ⚙️ Data Processing & Modeling
Key steps performed:
1. Data cleaning and transformation (handling missing values, standardizing country and region names).
2. Creation of calculated measures using DAX:
   - Total Confirmed Cases
   - Total Active Cases
   - Total Recoveries
   - Total Deaths
   - Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
   - Recovery Rate
   - Monthly Growth Rate
3. Data modeling to support time-based and regional analysis.
4. Design of an interactive dashboard with filters for Date, Region, and Country.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Global confirmed cases increased significantly between January and July 2020, with exponential growth observed in mid-2020.
- North America and Europe recorded the highest confirmed cases and deaths, indicating severe pandemic impact.
- Recovery rates improved steadily over time, reflecting advancements in treatment and response measures.
- Case fatality rates varied significantly across countries, suggesting differences in healthcare capacity and response strategies.
- Some countries exhibited high growth rates despite moderate confirmed cases, indicating emerging hotspots.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, deaths, CFR, and recovery rate
- Trend analysis of confirmed cases, recovery rates, and fatality rates
- Geographic visualization of CFR by country using maps
- Regional and country-level comparisons
- Interactive filters and drill-down capabilities

## 💡 Business & Analytical Implications
- Regional disparities highlight the need for targeted public health interventions.
- Monitoring CFR and recovery rates helps assess healthcare system performance.
- Trend analysis supports early identification of emerging risk regions.
- Data-driven insights can guide policy decisions and resource allocation.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can transform complex public health data into meaningful insights. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of COVID-19 trends and supports data-driven understanding of global pandemic dynamics.
